# Sign-Language-Detection-LSTM-Deep-Learning-Model
An action recognition deep learning model built in Jupyter notebook using Python
<br>
## Project Overview

## Used Python Libraries
## Next steps
- Translator robot
- Sign language to normal language (display on LCD)
- Language (by input buttons, e.g., first button: thanks) to sign language (shown by image popup), very limited phrases, can be improved by getting input by typing, more memory, webcam can be replaced with camera on the robot, LCD to screen on the robot
